## Garbage collection
##### Cleaning up old data

Curently, most data is not removed.

When an artist deletes an artwork, its data is removed from the artist-tekuma firebase database.

Though, its image files are kept in the  `art-uploads` storage bucket.

All other data is kept.

Data and files for rejected submissions are also kept.
