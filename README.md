The ambition of this repository is to be a central source of documentation.

For particular packages, files, etc., API documentation and other detailed
comments should usually be placed in the respective repository. General designs,
protocols, cross-cutting considerations, etc., should be placed here. In this
repository, there are also guides that are relevant for onboarding of new
engineers, e.g., describing code review process.
